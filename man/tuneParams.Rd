\title{Launch shiny gadget for tuning parameters}
\usage{
tuneParams(p, catch = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{MizerParams object to tune. If missing, the gadget tries to recover
information from log files left over from aborted previous runs.}

\item{catch}{Data frame holding binned observed catch data. The data can
be binned either into length bins or weight bins. In the former case the data
frame should have columns \code{length} and \code{dl} holding the start of
the size bins in cm and the width of the size bins in cm respectively. In
the latter case the data frame should have columns \code{weight} and
\code{dw} holding the start of the size bins in grams and the width of the
size bins in grams. The data frame also needs to have the columns
\code{species} (the name of the species), \code{catch} (the number of
individuals of a particular species caught in a size bin).

This gadget is meant for tuning a model to steady state. It is not meant for
tuning the dynamics of the model. That should be done in a second step using
functions like \code{setRmax()} or \code{changePlankton()}.

The function opens a shiny gadget, an interactive web page. This page has
a side panel with controls for various model parameters and a main panel
with tabs for various diagnostic plots.

After you click the "Done" button in the side panel, the function will return
the parameter object in the state at that time, with \code{Rmax} set to \code{Inf}
and \code{erepro} set to the value it had after the last run to steady state.

The gadget keeps a log of all steady states you create while working with
the gadget. You can go back to the last steady state by hitting the "Undo"
button. You can go back an arbitrary number of states and also go forward
again. There is also a button to go right back to the initial steady state.
When you leave the gadget by hitting the "Done" button, this log is cleared.
If you stop the gadget from RStudio by hitting the "Stop" button, then the
log is left behind. You can then restart the gadget by calling \code{tuneParams()}
without a \code{params} argument and it will re-instate the states from the log.

At any time the gadget allows the user to download the current params object
as an .rds file via the "Download" button in the "File" section, or to
upload a params object from an .rds file.

There are currently several restrictions on what the gadget can do:

The gadget currently assumes that each species is selected by only one gear.
It allows the user to change the parameters for that gear. It also enforces
the same effort for all gears. It sets all efforts to that for the first
gear and then allows the user to change that single effort value.}
